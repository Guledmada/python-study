# TASK 2: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Prompt the user for a number either on a form input or the terminal.
#  Depending on whether the number is even or odd, display 
# either “odd” or “even” to the user.
#  Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
# Extras:
# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out “divisible by 4”.

# numbers = int(input("Enter a number "))
# if numbers % 2 == 0:
#     num = "This is an even number "
#     if numbers % 4 ==0:
#         num = "divisible by four "
    
# else:
#     num = "This is an odd number "
# print(num)

fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
