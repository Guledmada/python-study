# name = "Adam"
# name = ("Kevin")
# print(name)
# age = input("Enter a number ")
# print(age)
# number1 = input("Enter number one ")
# number2 = input("Enter number two ")
# add = float (number1) + float (number2)

#python data types: 
#1 strings texts that are enclosed with quotations either singleor double
# it is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotations
#example is: "Hello World" , 
# city = """Nairobi,
# kampala, Arusha, Kigali"""
# print(city)
# first_name = "Guled"
# last_name = "Adam"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# print(full_name)




#2 integers are whole numbers without decimal points
#example 0,102,10


#3 floats are numbers with decimal points exampl 3.14, 0.20,100.6


#4 Boolean is True or False

#5 List is an ordered collection of items. they can be of 
#different data types ex: 
# cars = ["Toyota", "BMW", "254", 100, True]
# print(cars)

# Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs, the keys are 
#  unique 

#6 Tuples is similar to list but they are immutable and cannot be changed or altered.
#7 Set is unordered collection of unique items

    #Strings

#creating strings 
# message = "Hello Python World "
#accesing characters in a string
#you can access individual characters using indexing
#indexing is used for ordered data types, 
#sarting from the left you start with '0' adn starting from the right you start with '-1'
# print(message [6])
#slicing- is extracting a portion of a string, when slicing you use indexing
#the first indexing is where you start and the last indexing is plus one.
# print(message [:])

#combining strings using + is concantination 

#string methods - are used to manipulate or modify strings
# you use . sign after the variable
# text = "    HeLLo tHere..     "
# text = text.replace("..", " ")
# striped_text = text.strip()
# clean_text = striped_text.capitalize()
# print(clean_text)
# #len function is to determine the number of characters in a string
# print(len(text))

hello = "Hello World"
# print(hello.split)

#Integers is defined as whole numbers without a decimal
#can be both positive or negative numbers and are not surrounded by anything
# numbers do not have methods compared to strings 
x = 10
y = 99
z = '10'
# print(x) 

#floats are used to represent numbers with decimal points or scientific notations
#you can also use float to perform arithmetic operations 
a = 3.14
b = -2.5
c = 1.0e4
# print(type(c))

#booleans is True or False values. they are conditional statement
#booleans are oftenly used
#logical operators 
a = True
b = False
# print(type(b))

#operators in python are various. their main function is to operate on variables

#1 arithemtic operators: they perform arithmetic operations

#addition is +
a = 10
b = 50
# sum = (a + b)
# print(sum)
#substraction is - 
#multiplication is *
#division is /
#modulus is % it calculates the remainder
#exponential is ** it calculates the power 
#floor operator(//) example 20//3 

#2 compariosn operators: are used to compare variables or values and returns boolen

# equal to we use the == while the single = is used as assignment operator
a == b
# print(a==b)

#not equal to is the opposite of equal to
#we use the sign != 

# print(a != b)

#greate than operator is > 
# print(a > b)

#less than operator is <
# print(a < b)

# great or equal to is >=
# less or equal to is <= 

#3 Logical operators: are used to perform logical operation on variables and values.
# example1: and operator you use the word 'and'
#and operator only return true when all values are true.
#if one value is true and one false it returns false. 

# print(a > 30 and b > 30)

#example2: or operator you use the word 'or'
#or operator only looks for one true and entire operation is true
print(a > 30 or b > 30)

#example3 : not operator is simply the 

# #4 assignment operators 
# (=) assignment
# (+=) add and assign a+=be
# (-=) subtract and assign a-=b
